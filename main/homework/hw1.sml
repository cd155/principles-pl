    Write a function date_to_string that takes a date and returns a string 
    of the form January 20, 2013 (for example). Use the operator ^ for 
    concatenating strings and the library function Int.toString for converting 
    an int to a string. For producing the month part, do not use a bunch of 
    conditionals. Instead, use a list holding 12 strings and your answer to 
    the previous problem. For consistency, put a comma following the day and 
    use capitalized English month names: January, February, March, April, May, 
    June, July, August, September, October, November, December.
